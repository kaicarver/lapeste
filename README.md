# What

I want a readable version of _La Peste_ by Camus, and maybe other books.

HTML versions, works in progress:

* [La Peste](https://raw.githack.com/kaicarver/lapeste/master/lapeste.html)
* [Ignition!](https://raw.githack.com/kaicarver/lapeste/master/ignition.html)

## La Peste

I'm starting with a copy/paste from a PDF I found I forgot where (I think it was [ebooksgratuits.com](https://www.ebooksgratuits.com/)). It's pretty horrible, with no margins, but hey, better than nothing.

Turns out _La Peste_ is copyright-free in Canada, but not in France.

So French users, please do not download or even look at this, unless you're feeling Canadian.

Otherwise I'll just have to make this private.

UPDATE: Actually, [the text has already been converted to HTML](https://www.ebooksgratuits.com/html/camus_la_peste.html) on the ebooksgratuits site, rather well, from a Microsoft Word doc, it would seem.
That version was a bit hidden, because a search for the book on the same web site returns ["Téléchargement interdit dans l'Union européenne et la Suisse"](https://www.ebooksgratuits.com/details.php?book=2370).

The text from the PDF needs formatting:

 * remove hard carriage returns within paragraphs
 * better paragraph spacing
 * remove repeated lines
 * remove hyphenation at end of lines

The text converts pretty easily to Markdown,
which can then easily be turned to HTML or whatever.

I'd also like to make it suitable for reading out loud (by a machine).

Could use, for example, this kind of speech synthesis:

And there could even be a kind of read and play mode, à la [YH Chang Industries](https://www.yhchang.com/).

## Ignition!

I had the same thought for another text that needs formatting, 
_IGNITION! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants_,
by John D. Clark, which is totally free as far as I know.

Thanks to [Lex Fridman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1236563052788580352) for mentioning it.

This is the source for the text:

It has some similar formatting issues as the text I found for _La Peste_.
