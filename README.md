# La Peste project

Goal: make a readable version of La Peste by Albert Camus for myself.

I'm starting with a copy/paste from a PDF I found I forgot where, I'll add it if I find it, just for reference. It's pretty horrible, with no margins, but hey, better than nothing.

Turns out La Peste is copyright-free in Canada, but not in France.

So French users, please do not download or even look at this, unless you're feeling Canadian.

Otherwise I'll just make this private.

The text from the PDF needs formatting: 
 * remove hard carriage returns within paragraphs
 * better paragraph spacing
 * remove repeated lines, that seem pretty easy to spot

Later I can do something more clever than text, like HTML

And I'd like to make it suitable for reading out loud (by a machine)

And there could even be a kind of read and play mode, a la YH Chang Industries

I had the same thought for another text that needs formatting, Ignition, which I may add in here, and which is totally free as far as I know.
